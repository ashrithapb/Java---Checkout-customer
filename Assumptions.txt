Assumptions:
1. Credit card validation is done using Luhn Algorithm.
Any credit card number should pass following test:
From the rightmost digit, we should double every second digit. If the double is greater than 9, then add the both digits so that final number is of single digit.
Now sum all the digits in the number, the unchanged numbers and the doubled numbers.
The final sum should be multiple of 10 or mod 10 of the number should be 0. If itâ€™s not then its not a valid credit card number.
2. authorization number is valid if it is in the range :1000 and 9999 Otherwise it is not a valid authorization number.
3. Reference number is a 4 digit random number.
